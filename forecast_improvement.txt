Forecasted New Cases for the Next 7 Days:


To improve the accuracy of the forecast, incorporating additional data such as weather patterns, mobility data, and government policies (like lockdowns or vaccination rates) could provide more context to the predictions. Enhancing the model by considering external regressors in a SARIMAX model or using machine learning approaches like LSTM could also be explored.

Statistical Modeling with SARIMAX:

Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX) is a powerful statistical model that can handle both seasonal variations and external influences on the data. For forecasting COVID-19 cases, this model can utilize external regressors like local weather conditions (which can affect viral transmission) and mobility indices.
For instance, implementing a SARIMAX model would involve defining the order of seasonal differencing (S), auto-regression (AR), and moving average (MA) components, along with integrating the impact of external regressors like policy changes or mobility trends.
Machine Learning Approaches:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: These are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for sequence prediction problems. LSTMs can effectively capture long-term dependencies and patterns in time-series data, making them ideal for predicting the spread of diseases over time.
